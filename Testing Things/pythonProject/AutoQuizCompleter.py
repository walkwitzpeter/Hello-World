I DON'T PROMISE THE SECURITY OF THIS PROGRAM!!!!!!

However if you still want to use it, enter your username and password below.
This program should complete 10 quizzes for you, 
 HOWEVER you will have to answer the captcha at the end of each quiz. 
 After you answer the captcha you will need to enter a user input into the program
 (I run the program in PyCharm and so I just enter it in the PyCharm terminal)

Sorry I still am very new at this and don't know how to get it to auto answer the captcha,
 and much of my code is still pretty messy
 
Things that stop it from working:
    Having already completed one quiz today (especially one of the quizzes on here)
    Navigating to a different part of the website at any point (except for clicking the captcha)
